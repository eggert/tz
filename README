Please send comments or information to seismo!elsie!ado (with, perhaps,
carbon copes to cbosgd!mark, seismo!linus!encore!necis!geo, and
seismo!munnari!kre, who are responsible for any good ideas that show up here).

Historical local time information has been included here not because it should
be part of the standard (or, indeed, anyone's product), but rather to:

*	give people an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
	expected in the future;

*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
	system.
