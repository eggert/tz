# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, October 26, 1974
# and Sunday, October 27, 1974 editions of the Washington Post.

# Note also this from seismo!munnari!kre:
# "I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly
# sure enough of this to add anything."
# The above has been confirmed by Bob Devine; we'll go with it here.

# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# ...Alaska (and Hawaii) had the timezone names changed in 1967.
#    old                         new
#    Pacific Standard Time(PST)  -same-
#    Yukon Standard Time(YST)    -same-
#    Central Alaska S.T. (CAT)   Alaska-Hawaii Stnadard Time (AHST)
#    Nome Standard Time (NT)     Bering Standard Time (BST)
# 
# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part
#    of the Aleutian islands.   No DST.

# on February 8, 1987, by Dave Sherman of the Law Society of Upper Canada,
# "...Canada (well, Ontario and at least some of the other provinces) are

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):  "All of Canada did have DST from your
# first rule except Saskatchewan.  Which parts did not observe DST is hard
# to pinpoint but most of the province follows the rules.
# NOTE: those that didn't have DST for that rule, also
# probably did not have it for several years previous.

# Mexico

# From Guy Harris:
# Rules are from the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, for 1987.
# Rules prior to 1987 are unknown.
# The comments in the OAG say "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and Tijuana
# observe DST."  This is presumably Baja California Norte, above 28th parallel,
# as listed there; Mexico/BajaSur is for "Baja California Sur and N. Pacific
# Coast (States of Sinaloa and Sonora)."

# From Bob Devine:
# The Federal District (where Mexico City is) has observed [DST] several
# times but not recently.
# 
# I don't where to drawn the line in the North Baja area.  28th latitude
# sounds good -- but it may be higher (how far to radio stations from
# San Diego affect culture?).
# 
# The dates of DST probably go back to 1981.  The rules are the same as
# US's.  This is going to be a headache for US presidential electi[o]n years!

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Since the 1981 starting date is only "probable," we'll keep the 1987
# starting date below.
