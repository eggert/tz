# 
# To Paul's list of time zone information on the web, I would add the
# following URL:
#	<A HREF="http://www.dhl.com/dhl/dhlinfo/1bb.html">http://www.dhl.com/dhl/dhlinfo/1bb.html</A>
# or more simply:
#	<A HREF="http://www.dhl.com/">http://www.dhl.com/</A>
# 
# This is run by DHL (the courier company), and it presents a list of the  
# countries served by that company.  If you then click on a particular  
# country, here's an example of what you'll see (graphics stripped out):
# 
# United Kingdom
# 
# HOLIDAYS: Jan 1, 2, Apr 14, 17, May 1, 29, Aug 28, Dec 25, 26
# 
# INTERNATIONAL DIALING CODE: +44
# 
# CURRENT LOCAL TIME: 09:41 Monday 6 November 1995
# 
# I find this rather handy, and given that DHL covers 217 countries and  
# territories, it's pretty comprehensive coverage.
# 
# (I have no idea what system DHL is using to calculate the local time, but  
# it's been accurate so far.)
