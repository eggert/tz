.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tzselect
program asks the user for information about the current location,
and outputs the resulting time zone description to standard output.
The output is suitable as a value for the TZ environment variable.
.PP
All interaction with the user is done via standard input and standard error.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-c " coord
Instead of asking for continent and then country and then city,
ask for selection from time zones whose largest cities
are closest to the location with geographical coordinates
.I coord.
Use ISO 6709 notation for
.I coord,
that is, a latitude immediately followed by a longitude.  The latitude
and longitude should be signed integers followed by an optional
decimal point and fraction: positive numbers represent north and east,
negative south and west.  Latitudes with two and longitudes with three
integer digits are treated as degrees; latitudes with four or six and
longitudes with five or seven integer digits are treated as
.I "DDMM, DDDMM, DDMMSS,"
or
.I DDDMMSS
representing
.I DD
or
.I DDD
degrees,
.I MM
minutes,
and zero or
.I SS
seconds, with any trailing fractions represent fractional minutes or
(if
.I SS
is present) seconds.  The decimal point is that of the current locale.
For example, in the (default) C locale,
.B "\-c\ +40.689\-074.045"
specifies 40.689\(de\|N, 74.045\(de\|W,
.B "\-c\ +4041.4\-07402.7"
specifies 40\(de\|41.4\(fm\|N, 74\(de\|2.7\(fm\|W, and
.B "\-c\ +404121\-0740240"
specifies 40\(de\|41\(fm\|21\(sd\|N, 74\(de\|2\(fm\|40\(sd\|W.
If
.I coord
is not one of the documented forms, the resulting behavior is unspecified.
.TP
.BI "\-n " limit
When
.B \-c
is used, display the closest
.I limit
locations (default 10).
.TP
.BI "\-t " zonetabtype
Make selections from the time zone table of type
.I zonetabtype.
Possible
.I zonetabtype
values include:
.RS
.TP
.B time
A time zone table with a smaller set of zone names.
.TP
.B zone
A time zone table that also contains alternative zone names, for
backward compatibility with older versions of this software.  The
alternative names are not needed for proper operation of time stamps;
they are present only to avoid surprises with people who are
accustomed to the old names.  These alternative names arose from
political issues that are outside the scope of
.BR tzselect .
.PP
For example, both tables have entries for countries like
Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, which are in a zone where the clocks
have all agreed since 1970.  Although the
.B time
table lists "Europe/Belgrade" for this zone wherever it occurs, the
.B zone
table instead lists the names "Europe/Sarajevo", "Europe/Zagreb",
etc. under Bosnia, Croatia, etc.  This means that the
.B "\-t\ time"
option causes
.B tzselect
to generate "Europe/Belgrade" for this zone, whereas
.B "\-t\ zone"
causes it to generate different names depending on the country,
names that are equivalent in effect to "Europe/Belgrade".
.PP
The default
.I zonetabtype
is system-dependent, so applications that care about the set of
names that
.B tzselect
generates should use the
.B "\-t"
option.  Regardless of what options are used, applications should not
assume that
.BR tzselect 's
output matches the user's political preferences.
.RE
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
Output help information and exit.
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Output version information and exit.
